# meta-import

This is a collection of scripts used for importing flipnotes in to the database.

# Usage
To get a list of kwz files from `~/kwz/`, do `python3 listFiles.py`.

Otherwise, create a file with 1 full file path per line, and the script will act on each file.

`php parse_meta.php`

Note: the password for the database is contained in `password.txt` and is omitted from the repository for security.
